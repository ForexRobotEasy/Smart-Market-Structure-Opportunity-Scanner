# Smart Market Structure Opportunity Scanner

This code is a sample implementation of a market scanner that aims to identify potential trading opportunities in the forex market. It utilizes the MetaQuotes Language 5 (MQL5) and is designed to be used with the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) trading platform.

## How it Works

1. **Customizable Forex Pair Lists:** The code allows the user to define a list of forex pairs to be analyzed. By default, the code includes the following pairs: EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, AUDUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD, NZDUSD. Additional pairs can be added to the list if needed.

2. **Comprehensive Market Analysis:** The code performs a comprehensive analysis of each forex pair in the list. It retrieves various market information such as the highest and lowest values for the day and month, as well as historical data for preceding days, weeks, and up to 24 months. This information helps identify market trends and potential trading opportunities.

3. **Real-time Market Data:** The code continuously updates and displays real-time market data, including the bid and ask prices for each forex pair. This allows traders to have up-to-date information for making trading decisions.

4. **Trading Entry and Exit Signals:** The code generates entry and exit signals based on the analyzed market data. The specific logic for generating these signals is not provided in this sample code and should be implemented separately. The CalculateEntrySignal and CalculateExitSignal functions serve as placeholders and should be replaced with actual trading algorithms.

5. **User Interface:** The code provides a basic user interface by printing the analyzed market data and generated entry and exit signals for each forex pair. This allows traders to easily monitor the market and make informed trading decisions.
